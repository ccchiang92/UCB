###Observations
* 1. The vast majority of players are male and between the ages of 15-29.
* 2. The average purchase price is quite uniform between all gender and age groups, 
     and in Total purchase there aren't huge difference between the groups either.
* 3. Popular Items tend to be more expensive as well, and more popular items are also very profitable

P.S. a couple notes, didn't specify tie breakers in most popular items so just use the first one came up in my sort and was different from the sample solution
     Also in the last part calling .unique() on a groupby object turn the item names from strings to a list containing the string, didn't find a simple fix
