First 
	I Looped through the worksheets from the start so both solutions have code looping thorugh each worksheet

Second
	I'm using the datatype LongLong, documentation was a little confusing, but it works for my version
	which is office 365, not sure if it'll for every version, (maybe ULong instead)
