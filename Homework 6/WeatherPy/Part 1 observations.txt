1. From the linear regression plots, with high r square values and the spread of data points
   we can see there is very strong correlation between latitude and temperatures,
   the farther from the equator the colder it gets.
2. Since r squared is much higher in the north, the temperature correlation is strong for northen hemisphere cities,
   but fairly weak for southern cities in the random cities choosen
3. Wind speed, humidity and cloudiness all show very little correlation, as the r values are super low, almost non existent for most. 
   We can also see from the spread of the data points, there is no clear distinct shape.
   only humidity in the northen hemisphere have a minor correlation to latitude.
