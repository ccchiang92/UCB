# ML Hw

I tried most of the models from class including logistic regression, SVC, KNN, decision tree, and random forests \
KNN and random forest performed the best \ 
others performed around low 60% \
the better performing ones might just be they are more complex, running more nodes/operations \
Because i did not spend a ton of time to trim down features, i used 32 out of 41 columns total \
If I ran the models with less features, I think the performance would increase \
Ultimately random forest performed the best and I save that one at 77%
